Integer N (number of vertices) on the first line.\n    2. N lines, each with a unique alphanumeric node ID (up to 30 chars).\n    3. Indefinite lines of triplets: <id_1> <id_2> <weight> (non-negative integer).\n\n    The overall process must implement:\n    1. **Minimum Feedback Edge Set (FES) Candidates:** Identify all sets of edges with minimum cardinality\n       whose removal makes the graph a DAG.\n    2. **DAG Construction:** Select and remove the FES candidate with the **maximum total weight**\n       (sum of weights of edges in the set).\n    3. **Maximum Distances:** In the constructed DAG, calculate the maximum distance (longest path)\n       from every source node to all other reachable nodes (using Topological Sort).\n\n    Returns:\n    - A dictionary representing the final DAG's adjacency list (Node ID -> list of (neighbor_id, weight)).\n    - A dictionary of maximum distances: {source_node_id: {target_node_id: max_distance}}.\n    \"\"\"\n    pass",
